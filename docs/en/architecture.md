# Architecture

> 日本語版: [../ja/architecture.md](../ja/architecture.md)

## Purpose

Create and visualize routing plans for the YAMAHA URX22 / URX44 / URX44V in a GUI, constraining
the editor so that only paths the device physically allows can be wired. Plans persist as JSON and
can be exported as images. In the future the same plan data will be reflected onto real
hardware.

## Tech stack and rationale

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 | Ship Windows 11 / Apple silicon macOS from one source. Small binary. Future hardware control can be implemented natively in Rust |
| Frontend | TypeScript + Vite | The planning UI is pure frontend. It can be verified in a browser even without Rust |
| Rendering | Plain SVG | Draws the node-graph wiring. Keeps the no-runtime-dependency policy |
| Persistence | JSON | Human-readable. Also serves as the input for future hardware reflection |

Hardware control is handled on the Tauri (Rust) side, and the UI and core (model / constraints /
plan) are kept shell-independent.

## Data model

- **DeviceModel** — an immutable per-model device definition. It holds `nodes` (inputs / channels /
  buses / outputs / duckers), `rules` (legal paths = `RoutingRule[]`), and `channelPairs` (the mono
  channels that share one input source — CH1/2, CH3/4). `models/build.ts` generates it from per-model
  parameters. A ducker points at the stereo channel it rides on via `attachTo`; the UI draws it hung
  just below that channel ([below](#ducker-placement)).
- **Plan** — the mutable state the user creates. It holds `modelId`, node positions (`positions`),
  connections (`connections`), per-connection parameters (level / pan / pre-post, etc.),
  hidden nodes (`hidden`), and per-node notes (`notes`) with their minimized state
  (`noteCollapsed`). It serializes to JSON.
  A new plan comes from `defaultPlan(modelId)` in `models/initial-state.ts`. Models whose factory
  initial state has been captured (URX44V only so far) are seeded with those defaults (node
  parameters + routing); models without a capture start from an empty plan (`emptyPlan` in
  `core/plan.ts`) and fall back to the inspector's per-field defaults. A device fetch starts from
  `emptyPlan` and lets the readback (`core/control/`) fill in the live values.

The constraint core (`core/routing.ts`):

- `legalTargets(model, plan, fromRef)` — returns the set of input ports an output port can connect to.
- `legalSources(model, plan, toRef)` — the reverse: the output ports that can connect into an input
  port, so a wire can be dragged from the input side as well.
- `canConnect(model, plan, fromRef, toRef)` — checks rule existence and receiver multiplicity
  (`source` / `patch` / `key` accept one wire; `send` accepts many).
- `partnerChannel(model, nodeId)` — returns the paired mono channel. A `source` wire is mirrored onto
  the partner (and removed together with it) so a channel pair always shares one input source (UI: `graph.ts`).
  A ducker key source is the `key` kind, not `source`, so it never enters this mirroring — guaranteed by the
  kind rather than by the incidental fact that duckers are not in `channelPairs`.

The UI (`graph.ts`) uses these to let a wire be dragged from either an output or an input port,
highlighting the legal ports on the opposite side via `legalTargets` / `legalSources`. Clicking a
single-input port that already holds a source selects that wire, the same as clicking the wire itself.

For the detailed routing rules, see [device-model.md](device-model.md) (derived from the official
block diagram).

## Localization (i18n)

The UI is English-first with Japanese localization. The implementation is a dependency-free,
in-house module `src/i18n/`:

- `en.ts` — the base language and the source of truth for the message shape (the `Messages` type).
  It contains strings and interpolation functions.
- `ja.ts` — the Japanese translation that satisfies `Messages`. Adding a key makes TypeScript
  require a translation in every language.
- `index.ts` — the current language state, `t()` (returns the active catalog), and
  `setLang()` / `onLangChange()`. On startup it reads `localStorage("urx-lang")`; if absent it
  detects from `navigator.language`, with English as the final fallback.

> **The core stays language-agnostic.** `canConnect` in `core/routing.ts` returns failures as
> `ConnectError` codes, and `deserialize` in `core/plan.ts` throws a `PlanError` (with a code). The
> UI maps them to text (`t().error[code]`). This keeps `core/` and `models/` free of i18n, so the
> Node smoke test runs without browser APIs.

The language button at the right end of the toolbar switches languages; `setLang()` notifies
listeners, which re-render the static labels and the inspector.

> **Terminology.** Keep product / industry terms in English even in the Japanese UI: `Bus`,
> `Ducker`, `Bus send`, `Send (ON/OFF)`, `Pre-fader send`. The visible canvas element is a **node**;
> reserve "module" for software modules (`src/i18n/` etc.). The legend groups the wire kinds under
> "Connection types" and the node kinds under "Nodes".

## Display themes

The UI has a studio-rack aesthetic modeled on pro-audio gear, with two themes: dark and light. The
initial theme uses a saved choice (`localStorage("urx-theme")`) if present, otherwise it follows the
OS color scheme (`prefers-color-scheme`), falling back to dark when the OS does not prefer light (the
same "saved → system → fallback" order as the initial language). The button at the right end of the
toolbar toggles it, persisting to `localStorage("urx-theme")`.

The palette is split into two layers, kept in correspondence per theme:

- HTML elements (toolbar / inspector / background) — CSS custom properties in `src/style.css`
  (`:root` is dark, `[data-theme="light"]` is light; the attribute is set on `document.documentElement`).
- SVG nodes / wires — `PALETTES.dark` / `PALETTES.light` in `src/ui/graph.ts`. `setTheme()` re-renders.
  Light-theme nodes also get a soft drop shadow (`#node-shadow` filter) for physical lift.

The connection and node colors live in both layers: wire colors as `--w-*` (CSS) / `PALETTES.wire`
(graph.ts), and node-rail colors as `--rail-*` (CSS) / `PALETTES.rail`. The inspector's empty-state
**legend** reads the CSS variables, so it labels exactly the colors the graph draws and follows the theme.

> As with model/rule consistency (device-model.md ↔ models/), **keep the theme palette in sync
> between the CSS variables in style.css and `PALETTES` in graph.ts** — wire (`--w-*` ↔ `PALETTES.wire`),
> node rail (`--rail-*` ↔ `PALETTES.rail`), and the surface colors.
> Exception: `key` (the ducker key source) shares `source`'s blue and has no separate legend row, so it
> carries only a `PALETTES.wire.key` entry for rendering and no `--w-key` CSS variable (the `--w-*`
> variables back the legend swatches only).

PNG and PDF export (`core/storage.ts`) read `--canvas-bg` to paint the background, so the exported
image follows the current theme too. The PDF is a hand-built single-page document embedding one
FlateDecode image (deflate via the platform `CompressionStream`), so no runtime dependency is added.

## Responsive layout (mobile)

The inspector — a fixed 300px column on desktop — becomes a bottom sheet (a rack drawer that slides up
from the foot of the screen) on narrow viewports (≤720px). Its visibility is driven by CSS alone:
`main.ts` toggles a single `has-selection` class on `<body>` from whether anything is selected, and
`body.has-selection #inspector` raises the sheet with `transform: translateY(0)` (off-screen at
`translateY(105%)` otherwise). It is dismissed by the heading's ✕ button (`onClose` →
`graph.clearSelection()`, reusing the existing deselect path) or by tapping empty canvas. Canvas zoom
works by mouse wheel (desktop) and two-finger pinch (touch); both share one "zoom about a fixed point"
routine (`zoomAt` in `graph.ts`). `viewport-fit=cover` plus `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` clears the
notch / home indicator, and the toolbar drops its decorative VU meter + tagline below 720px.

## Hiding unconnected nodes

On larger models the nodes a plan never wires up take space and clutter the diagram, so **only
nodes with no connections** can be collapsed off the canvas. Hidden nodes collect on a **shelf**
docked along the bottom (an HTML overlay `graph.ts` builds — kept out of the SVG, so it never shows in
an export) as rail-colored chips; clicking a chip restores that one, and "Show all" restores them all.

- The toolbar "Hide unused" shelves every node with no *editable* connections. The inspector adds a
  "Hide this node" button when the selected node has none.
- **Multi-select**: Ctrl/Cmd-clicking nodes toggles them into a selection without dragging. With two or
  more selected, a floating action bar (an HTML overlay, like the shelf) offers a batch "Hide" — it
  shelves only the shelvable nodes in the selection (the same invariant) and reports any connected ones
  it kept. "Clear" and `Escape` drop the selection. The selection set is transient view state, not
  persisted.
- **Invariant**: only a node with no editable connection can be hidden. Fixed CH/FX → STEREO wires do
  not count (a channel carrying just its fixed STEREO wire is still shelvable), and such a wire is
  skipped while either endpoint is hidden — so rendering never leaves a wire dangling. Assigning a real
  source/send un-shelves the node (it is hidden only while in `hidden` *and* free of editable wires).
- **Ducker exception**: a ducker can be shelved on its own even while it carries a key-source wire
  (that wire is skipped while the ducker is hidden, so the source-side port also stops reading as in
  use). Hiding a parent channel hides its ducker too, and restoring the ducker restores the parent —
  a ducker is never shown without its channel. On the shelf, a parent and its hidden ducker collapse
  into one chip (the child chip is suppressed); restoring the parent chip brings the whole unit back.
- The hidden set persists as `plan.hidden` (an array of node ids) and is restored on load. Like
  `positions`, it is pure view state and does not affect routing rules (future hardware reflection may
  ignore it).
- The bulk "hide" and "show all" re-fit the diagram to reclaim space; while the shelf is open `fitView`
  frames the content above it, and a single restored node is parked at the viewport center.

## Ducker placement

A ducker is a sidechain key-source selector that *rides on* its stereo channel rather than being a
standalone output. It therefore carries its own `"ducker"` kind (a dedicated rail color), stays out of
the output column, and is drawn **hung at a fixed gap directly below** the parent channel it names via
`attachTo`.

- **Derived position** — a ducker's coordinates are never stored in `plan.positions`; they are always
  derived from the parent (`posOf` follows `attachTo` and offsets by the parent's height + gap), so it
  tracks the parent even when the parent's note expands.
- **Moves as one** — dragging the parent moves the child by the same delta; grabbing the child (ducker)
  redirects the drag to the parent, so either grab moves the unit. The child cannot be moved on its own.
- **Tether** — a single thin rail-colored line spans the gap to the parent, marking the two as one unit.
- **Auto-layout** — `autoLayout` skips the ducker and reserves the child's height below its parent.

## Node labels

The label sits at a fixed left inset and must clear the header button (its visible box starts near the
right edge), which leaves room for roughly 15 monospace characters. Longer labels are handled two ways:
a node with a `sublabel` stacks two tiers in the fixed-height header — the node name, then a dim
secondary legend below it (e.g. a ducker's `CH 3/4 · Source`); a long single-line label with no sublabel
is shrunk just enough by `fitScale` to stay clear of the button (`microSD Playback`, `HDMI (down-mix)`).
Lists and the inspector show both tiers joined via `fullLabel()` so no context is lost.

## Node notes

Each node can carry a free-text note. The note renders **inside the node frame**, below the
header, in a recessed panel; the node grows downward to contain it while the header (label, jacks,
wires) stays anchored, so routing is unaffected. Notes are part of the SVG, so they appear in PNG /
PDF exports.

- **Add** — a note-less node shows a faint pen button at the header right (`graph.ts` `makeNoteAdd`).
  Clicking it (or double-clicking the node) opens an in-place editor: a floating HTML `<textarea>`
  positioned over the panel, kept out of the export.
- **Edit** — once a node is selected, clicking its open note area edits it; the header (outside the
  note) still drags the node, and an unselected node drags from anywhere. Editing is canvas-only —
  the inspector has no note field.
- **Minimize / expand** — a noted node shows a `+` / `−` button (`makeNoteToggle`): `−` minimizes
  the note to the header, `+` re-expands it. The minimized state persists per node.
- **Persistence & layout** — notes persist as `plan.notes` (node id → text) and the minimized set as
  `plan.noteCollapsed`, both pure view state (future hardware reflection may ignore them). `Arrange` stacks each column
  by the nodes' actual heights (`nodeHeight`, expanded note included), so a note never overlaps the
  node below it.

## Persistence format

```jsonc
{
  "format": "urx-router-plan",
  "version": 1,
  "modelId": "URX44V",
  "sampleRate": 48000,
  "positions": { "ch1": { "x": 1, "y": 0 } },
  "connections": [
    { "from": "in.micline1:out", "to": "ch1:in", "kind": "source" },
    { "from": "ch1:out", "to": "bus.stereo:in", "kind": "send",
      "params": { "level": 0, "pan": 0, "tap": "post" } }
  ],
  "hidden": ["in.micline2", "out.sdrec"],
  "notes": { "ch1": "Lead vox — comp + chorus +2 dB" },
  "noteCollapsed": ["ch1"]
}
```

Phase 1 implemented save/load with browser standards (Blob download / file input). Phase 2 adds
native save/open dialogs (`tauri-plugin-dialog`) plus a recent-plans list; file IO uses small
`std::fs` app commands (`read_text_file` / `write_text_file` / `write_binary_file`). Everything is
reached via `core/platform.ts` through `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke`, so no Tauri npm package
is bundled; when not running under Tauri it falls back to the browser path. The plan format is
unchanged apart from the added `sampleRate`, `hidden`, `notes` and `noteCollapsed` fields (older files
default them on load).

## Build and distribution

Installers are produced by `pnpm tauri build`, which embeds `frontendDist`
(`../dist`) into the binary. A plain `cargo build` artifact instead reads
`devUrl` and shows a blank window without the dev server (always verify with
`tauri build`). The app version has a single source: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` sets `version`
to `"../package.json"`, so Tauri reads it from the root `package.json` at build time (`Cargo.toml`'s
version stays independent as the crate version).

| Platform | Output | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple silicon) | `.dmg` + `.app` (`src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`) | arm64 only; ad-hoc signed (Gatekeeper warning until notarized) |
| Windows | `.msi` + `.exe` (NSIS) | built on a Windows host or in CI; cross-compiling from macOS is unsupported |

Releases are automated by `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Pushing a `vX.Y.Z`
tag (or `vX.Y.Z-{alpha,beta,rc}*` for a prerelease) runs three jobs: `check-tag`
validates the tag, `create-release` opens a **draft** GitHub Release, and a
`build` matrix (`macos-14` / `windows-latest`) packages each platform with
[`tauri-action`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action) and attaches the
bundles to the draft. The draft is left for manual review before publishing. A
manual `workflow_dispatch` run builds without creating a release, uploading the
bundles as job artifacts only (to verify the packaging pipeline).

macOS signing and notarization are optional: when the signing secrets (`MACOS_SIGNING_CERT` /
`MACOS_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD` / `MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY`) and notarization secrets
(`MACOS_NOTARIZATION_USERNAME` / `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD` / `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_TEAM_ID`) are
present the workflow forwards them to `tauri-action`; otherwise it ships an unsigned bundle. The
secret names are shared with the author's other repos for reuse.
The Windows console window is already suppressed in release builds by
`windows_subsystem = "windows"` in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` (it appears in dev /
`cargo build`).

### Browser demo (GitHub Pages)

Separate from the desktop app, a browser-only demo is published to GitHub Pages. `vite build --mode demo`
(`pnpm build:demo`, with `.env.demo` setting `VITE_DEMO=1`) builds it, and `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
publishes `dist` to Pages on every push to `main`. The demo is a viewer, so file save / load and PNG / PDF
export are hidden from the toolbar (`src/core/env.ts`'s `DEMO` flag hides `[data-demo-hide]` elements). A
normal (desktop) build eliminates that branch as dead code and keeps every feature, so distributed binaries
are unaffected. `vite.config.ts`'s relative `base: "./"` lets assets resolve under a sub-path.

### Auto-update

The desktop app checks for a newer release at startup. The Tauri updater / process plugins are registered
in `src-tauri/` on desktop only, and the frontend calls `plugin:updater|check` /
`plugin:updater|download_and_install` / `plugin:process|restart` directly from `src/core/platform.ts`, the
same way as the dialog calls (no added npm runtime dependency). When an update exists it shows a confirm
dialog, then downloads, installs, and restarts. Browser / demo builds disable this via the `DEMO` branch,
which is eliminated as dead code.

Distribution rides on GitHub Releases. Enabling `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` in `tauri.conf.json` makes
`tauri-action` emit signed bundles plus a `latest.json`, served from the
`https://github.com/semnil/urx-router/releases/latest/download/latest.json` endpoint listed under
`plugins.updater.endpoints`. Update bundles **require a minisign signature**, with a key pair separate from
macOS code signing.

Generate and register the signing key (one-time):

```sh
pnpm tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/urx-router-updater.key
gh secret set TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY < ~/.tauri/urx-router-updater.key
gh secret set TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

- The printed **public key** is set in `plugins.updater.pubkey` in `tauri.conf.json` and committed — a
  public key is safe to commit.
- Keep the **private key** and its password out of git and register them as the secrets above (`release.yml`
  forwards them to `tauri-action`). Without the secrets the bundles are unsigned and no `latest.json` is
  produced, so auto-update will not work.

## Third-party licenses

The web layer ships with zero runtime dependencies, but a distributed desktop build statically links
the Tauri runtime and its Rust crates, which carry their own open-source licenses. None are
GPL/AGPL/LGPL — the set is permissive plus file-scoped weak-copyleft (MPL-2.0), all satisfied by
bundling their notices.

The notice file is generated from the Cargo dependency graph with
[`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about):

```sh
cargo install cargo-about            # once (or: brew install cargo-about)
cd src-tauri && cargo about generate about.hbs -o THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.html
```

`src-tauri/about.toml` lists the accepted SPDX ids, `src-tauri/about.hbs` is the output template, and
the generated `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.html` is git-ignored — regenerated for distribution, bundled as a
Tauri resource (an in-app credits view) in Phase 2, then wired into CI so a dependency change can't
silently drop a notice.
